The Jazz server requires libzmq (development version)!

1. If you haven't yet installed libzmq:

  You have to compile it from source.

  First download it (you can search for the latest version, 4.3.4 is okay):

    wget https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/download/v4.3.4/zeromq-4.3.4.tar.gz

  Extract it, change to the folder and autogen (to prepare it for installation)

	tar -xvf zeromq-4.3.4.tar.gz
	cd zeromq-4.3.4
	./autogen.sh

  Compile it (passing the tests is slower but recommended)

	./configure
	make check

  Install it

	sudo make install

2. If you know where to find the library (libzmq.so) and the header (zmq.h):

  You can set the paths (ONLY the paths, no extra characters) in _config_ as follows:

    echo '/home/me/my_lib/include' > _config_/zmq_include_path
    echo '/home/me/my_lib/libs'    > _config_/zmq_library_path

  and run ./config.sh again. It will use these paths instead of trying to guess.
