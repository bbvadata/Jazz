## Code chunks for config.sh

You will most probably not have to deal with the content of this folder. Here is where the code chunks live that support:

  - The only source of truth for the current version that propagates everywhere.
  - Optional settings for compilation including non standard paths for libraries.
  - Chunks to create the Makefile (for C++)
  - Chunks to create the Doxyfile (for Doxygen)
  - Chunks to create build.sh (for the R package)
  - Chunks to create the Dockerfile (for Docker)

There is no other reference of what is here than the **config.sh** script itself. Use **./config.sh --help** for simple options.
