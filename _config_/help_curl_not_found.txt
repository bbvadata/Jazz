The Jazz server requires libcurl (development version)!

1. If you haven't yet installed libcurl:

  You will have to install it with:

    .. apt:

       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install libcurl7-gnutls-dev   (or sudo apt-get install libcurl7-openssl-dev)

    .. yum:

       sudo yum install libcurl libcurl-devel

    .. rpm or other:

       Find an rpm package or follow https://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libcurl-devel

2. If you know where to find the library (libcurl.so) and the header (curl/curl.h):

  You can set the paths (ONLY the paths, no extra characters) in _config_ as follows:

    echo '/home/me/my_lib/include' > _config_/curl_include_path
    echo '/home/me/my_lib/libs'    > _config_/curl_library_path

  and run ./config.sh again. It will use these paths instead of trying to guess.
