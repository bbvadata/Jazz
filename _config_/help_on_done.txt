  Congratulations, you have successfully configured your project. Now,
you should be able to build and install the server.

  - cd server
  - make           // Shows help when invoked without arguments
  - make jazz      // Compiles the server in RELEASE mode
  - make install   // Requires sudo and installs as a Linux service
  - cd docker      // This has everything to build the docker images
