\section jazz_mods Jazz Modules Diagram

This diagram shows how the different Jazz modules fit. \n

![Jazz modules](diagrams/jazz_modules.png)

The maturity level of the different modules is:\n

Maturity | Description
-------- | -----------
nothing  | Code is complete and tested.
[PROTO]  | Code under active development, possibly working, but not release quality.
[DRAFT]  | Code under active development, PoC in Python and API closed, but no working implementation in Jazz.
[FUTURE] | Code not under active development. Working on PoC.
\n

There are three C++ namespaces:

1. jazz_elements (all the pieces: blocks, tuples, storage, fluxes, communication, services, ...)\n
2. jazz_bebop (everything to create bebop code, run it and expand Formal Fields)\n
3. jazz_agency (agency as graphs of fields)\n

Additionally, (4.), since everything is an http server, front-end developers build on the REST API\n
