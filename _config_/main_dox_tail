\section jazz_mods Jazz Modules Diagram

This diagram shows how the different Jazz modules fit. \n

![Jazz modules](diagrams/jazz_modules.png)

The maturity level of the different modules is:\n

Maturity | Description
-------- | -----------
nothing  | Code is complete and tested.
[TEST]   | Code is complete, but testing is not complete.
[PROTO]  | Code under active development, possibly working, but not release quality.
[DRAFT]  | Code under active development, PoC in Python and API closed, but no working implementation in Jazz.
[FUTURE] | Code not under active development. Working on PoC.
\n

There are three C++ namespaces, intended for general c++ Jazz programming, possibly using external Jazz servers, but not necessarily as
implemented as an http server:

1. jazz_elements (All the pieces: Blocks, Kinds, Tuples, storage, communication, services, etc.)\n
2. jazz_bebop (Everything to run bebop code: Bop (utils), OpCode, Pack, Snippet, Field, Core)\n
3. jazz_model (From objects to concepts, from code execution to code creation)\n
\n

Additionally, there is a namespace for the server:
\n\n

4. jazz_main (putting it all together, the http API and the server)
\n

And, of course, Jazz development is about making the server run Bebop code and interfacing via REST using python or any front-end tech via
the REST API.\n
