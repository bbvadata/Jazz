\section jazz_mods Jazz Modules 101

![Jazz modules](diagrams/jazz_modules.png)

This diagram shows how the different Jazz modules fit. Everything except the dotted nodes
is in the repository.\n
\n
A. Is the folder jazz_elements (all the pieces that work on blocks)\n
B. Is the folder jazz_functional (all the pieces that support higher level abstractions)\n
C. Is the folder jazz_main (for the http server only)\n
F. (not in this repo) Is where front-end developers build, see the [REST API reference](http://kaalam.github.io/jazz_reference/rest_reference.html)\n
\n
You will typically use (5) for extending the back-end in C++. (noted as (x))\n
You will typically use (4) for connect to other languages, other than R & Python.\n
You will typically use (3) to run R & Python scripts for both local and remote sources.\n
You will typically use (2) build docker images containing your applications.\n
\n
If you use (1), you are the end user, not a developer. ;-)\n
