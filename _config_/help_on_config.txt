This script creates:

  - server/src/include/jazz_platform.h (Version and platform const)
  - server/Makefile (for C++)
  - server/src/main.dox (main page for Doxygen)
  - docker/upload_docker.sh (build & upload reference Docker image)

config.sh usage:

  This script is not configured via arguments, but by creating text
"chunks" in the _config_ folder. The simple uses are described in
some _config_/help_* file.

Caveat:

  Do not make any assumptions about the future of this building process.
