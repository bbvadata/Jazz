// This is the MAIN Jazz configuration file.
// -----------------------------------------

	// Edit with care (you are declaring 'key = value' pairs):

		//	1. Empty lines and anything to the right of (including) // is removed.
		//	2. Unquoted space is removed (a = My Nice Folder, collapses to a=MyNiceFolder).
		//	3. Quotes must be paired, the parser is dumb, don`t expect any escape magic. Still, a = "My Nice Folder" works as you expect.
		//	4. Repeated keys are simply overridden, just the last definition counts.
		//	5. Keys could be defined with spaces "A hat" = "E(A)", but no such keys are used in Jazz.


// File paths
// ----------

STATIC_HTML_AT_START	= ./config/www/		// Pages (and any static content) to load at server start. Name of a folder with static files.
											// The folder will be recurred and everything will be uploaded to the path where http://*/*/*
											// maps to STATIC_HTML_AT_START/*/*/*. Mime type will be created automatically based on file
											// extensions.
MDB_PERSISTENCE_PATH	= ./jazz_dbg_mdb/	// Path to the local persistence (root directory). Each subdirectory in this is a source.


// Thread allocation limits
// ------------------------

// These values are limited by a hardcoded C++ constant JAZZ_MAX_NUM_THREADS, modify it if you need bigger requirements, otherwise,
// attempts to configure above that limit will result in Service.start() errors.

// RAM allocation limits
// ---------------------

// Note 1: As of version 0.5.x RAM is not preallocated, therefore, the _BLOCK_KBYTES are just maximum total allocation by each Service.
// The service will keep total allocation accountability, log warning over _WARN_BLOCK_KBYTES and deny allocation over _ERROR_BLOCK_KBYTES.
// Just configure unreasonable values for _ERROR_BLOCK_KBYTES if you don`t want the denial behavior.

// Note 2: The _MAX_TRANSACTIONS controls the maximum number of blocks and actually commits allocation for their Transaction structures
// even if not used.

MDB_ENV_SET_MAPSIZE		= 8192		// Size in Mb of the memory buffer used by LMDB. Set the size of the memory map to use

									// process. Note that the library does not check for this condition, the caller must
									// ensure it explicitly. The new size takes effect immediately for the current process
									// but will not be persisted to any others until a write transaction has been committed
									// by the current process. Also, only mapsize increases are persisted into the
									// environment. If the mapsize is increased by another process, and data has grown beyond
									// the range of the current mapsize, mdb_txn_begin() will return MDB_MAP_RESIZED. This
									// function may be called with a size of zero to adopt the new size. Any attempt to set a

									// Currently a moderate number of slots are cheap but a huge number gets expensive:
									// 7-120 words per transaction, and every mdb_dbi_open() does a linear search of the
									// opened slots.
MDB_FIXEDMAP			= 0			// Use a fixed address for the mmap region. This flag must be specified when creating the
									// environment, and is stored persistently in the environment. If successful, the memory
									// map will always reside at the same virtual address and pointers used to reference data
									// items in the database will be constant across multiple invocations. This option may
									// not always work, depending on how the operating system has allocated memory to shared
									// libraries and other uses. The feature is highly experimental.
MDB_WRITEMAP			= 0			// Use a writeable memory map unless MDB_RDONLY is set. This uses fewer mallocs but loses
									// protection from application bugs like wild pointer writes and other bad updates into
									// the database. This may be slightly faster for DBs that fit entirely in RAM, but is
									// slower for DBs larger than RAM. Incompatible with nested transactions. Do not mix
									// processes with and without MDB_WRITEMAP on the same environment. This can defeat

MDB_NOMETASYNC			= 1			// Flush system buffers to disk only once per transaction, omit the metadata flush. Defer
									// that until the system flushes files to disk, or next non-MDB_RDONLY commit or
									// mdb_env_sync(). This optimization maintains database integrity, but a system crash may
									// undo the last committed transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI(atomicity, consistency,
									// isolation) but not D (durability) database property. This flag may be changed at any
									// time using mdb_env_set_flags().
MDB_NOSYNC				= 1			// Don`t flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction. This optimization
									// means a system crash can corrupt the database or lose the last transactions if buffers
									// not yet flushed to disk. The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty
									// buffers to disk and how often mdb_env_sync() is called. However, if the filesystem
									// preserves write order and the MDB_WRITEMAP flag is not used, transactions exhibit ACI
									// (atomicity, consistency, isolation) properties and only lose D (durability). I.e.
									// database integrity is maintained, but a system crash may undo the final transactions.
									// Note that (MDB_NOSYNC | MDB_WRITEMAP) leaves the system with no hint for when to write
									// transactions to disk, unless mdb_env_sync() is called. (MDB_MAPASYNC | MDB_WRITEMAP)
									// may be preferable. This flag may be changed at any time using mdb_env_set_flags().
MDB_MAPASYNC			= 1			// When using MDB_WRITEMAP, use asynchronous flushes to disk. As with MDB_NOSYNC, a
									// system crash can then corrupt the database or lose the last transactions. Calling
									// mdb_env_sync() ensures on-disk database integrity until next commit. This flag may be

MDB_NOLOCK				= 1			// Don`t do any locking. If concurrent access is anticipated, the caller must manage all
									// concurrency itself. For proper operation the caller must enforce single-writer
									// semantics, and must ensure that no readers are using old transactions while a writer
									// is active. The simplest approach is to use an exclusive lock so that no readers may be
									// active at all when a writer begins.
MDB_NOREADAHEAD			= 1			// Turn off read ahead. Most operating systems perform read ahead on read requests by
									// default. This option turns it off if the OS supports it. Turning it off may help
									// random read performance when the DB is larger than RAM and system RAM is full.
MDB_NOMEMINIT			= 1			// Don`t initialize malloc`d memory before writing to unused spaces in the data file. By
									// default, memory for pages written to the data file is obtained using malloc. While
									// these pages may be reused in subsequent transactions, freshly malloc`d pages will be
									// initialized to zeroes before use. This avoids persisting leftover data from other code
									// (that used the heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the data file. Note that
									// many other system libraries may allocate and free memory from the heap for arbitrary
									// uses. E.g., stdio may use the heap for file I/O buffers. This initialization step has
									// a modest performance cost so some applications may want to disable it using this flag.
									// This option can be a problem for applications which handle sensitive data like
									// passwords, and it makes memory checkers like Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed
									// with MDB_WRITEMAP, which writes directly to the mmap instead of using malloc for
									// pages. The initialization is also skipped if MDB_RESERVE is used: the caller is
									// expected to overwrite all of the memory that was reserved in that case. This flag may
									// be changed at any time using mdb_env_set_flags().
