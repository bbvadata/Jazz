In one sentence: Jazz only uses <b>one</b> cookie that fits the gdpr definition of Strictly Necessary Cookie (SNC).

<h3>GDPR Definition of SNC</h3>

As mentioned in <a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/">https://gdpr.eu/cookies/</a>:

<p><i>"Cookies that are essential for you to browse the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the site.
Cookies that allow web shops to hold your items in your cart while you are shopping online are an example of strictly necessary
cookies. These cookies will generally be first-party session cookies. While it is not required to obtain consent for these cookies,
what they do and why they are necessary should be explained to the user."</i></p>

<h3>Is it necessary to obtain consent for using an SNC?</h3>

No. (See the previous paragraph.)

<h3>Is it necessary to explain the use of an SNC?</h3>

Yes. And we inform you that Jazz uses only one cookie. That it is strictly a first-party cookie, meaning it is not shared
with anyone. The exact form of the cookie is "jazz_user=(a temporary token invented by the server)". This cookie contains <b>no
personal information</b>, expires automatically and <b>will not be used to identify you</b>. It just creates a space in the server's
persistence to maintain a conversation. That conversation will not be permanently saved by us without your consent. If necessary, you
will be asked for consent explicitly in the conversation. The Jazz server does not implement cookie support other than what is
described in this document.

<h3>Other legislation</h3>

country. If you think there is something relevant in the application of this policy to your country's legislation, do not hesitate
