/** \brief Kind: A type definition for complex Jazz objects.

Kind objects contain the metadata only. A Tuple is a data object of a Kind. Kinds define more complex types than (raw) Blocks, even if
they are blocks. E.g., A Block can store a video of a fixed shape (image only or soundtrack only). A Kind can store both and have
**dimensions** defining things like: image_width, image_height, number_of_frames and, possibly, a subtitle track as another vector of
strings.

It is a block with special attributes to store a tree of (primitive type, block, kind). A Kind is a single Block! A kind has **dimensions**
which are integer variables that are used to define variable shapes.

Technically, a kind is a Block of type CELL_TYPE_KIND_ITEM. Each item contains data (is a Tensor). Even if kinds extend other kinds, only
the leaves of the tree (the tensors) are included in the resulting kind with the appropriate level. See TensorDim.

Since kinds keep only metadata, the space, unlike in Tuples, is uninterrupted as in a normal block: (header, vector of CELL_TYPE_KIND_ITEM,
attribute keys, StringBuffer).

The StringBuffer contains the item names and dimension names. See TensorDim.

Creating Kinds
--------------

Many Kind functionalities (including creating kinds and creating kinds from merging kinds) are done by Containers. This object, nevetheless
has a minimum of functionality to build by parts: new_kind(), add_item() to do the basic building which will be called by the
Container. It also has function to check the content and validate a kind.

Also, kinds should define, these attributes, but that it left to the Container:

- BLOCK_ATTRIB_BLOCKTYPE as the const "kind"
- BLOCK_ATTRIB_TYPE as the const "Kind"

		How dimensions are defined.
		---------------------------

		Dimensions are placehoders in the tensor shapes that contain an integer variable such as "width" instade of a constant. They are
		defined by placing a unique negative number for each dimension in the tensor and giving it a name inside the dims map. E.g.,
		if an image has shape [-1, -2, 3] and dims[-1] == "width" and dims[-2] == "height", The kind will store these variable dimensions
		together with their names.
