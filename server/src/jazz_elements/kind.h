/**< \brief Kind: A type definition for complex Jazz objects.

Kind objects contain the metadata only. A Tuple is a data object of a Kind. Kinds define more complex types than (raw) Blocks, even if
they are blocks. E.g., A Block can store a video of a fixed shape (image only or soundtrack only). A Kind can store both and have
**dimensions** defining things like: image_width, image_height, number_of_frames and, possibly, a subtitle track as another vector of
strings.

It is a block with special attributes to store a tree of (primitive type, block, kind). A Kind is a single Block! A kind has **dimensions**
which are integer variables that are used to define variable shapes.
