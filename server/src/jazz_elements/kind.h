/** \brief Kind: A type definition for complex Jazz objects.

Kind objects contain the metadata only. A Tuple is a data object of a Kind. Kinds define more complex types than (raw) Blocks, even if
they are blocks. E.g., A Block can store a video of a fixed shape (image only or soundtrack only). A Kind can store both and have
**dimensions** defining things like: image_width, image_height, number_of_frames and, possibly, a subtitle track as another vector of
strings.

It is a block with special attributes to store a tree of (primitive type, block, kind). A Kind is a single Block! A kind has **dimensions**
which are integer variables that are used to define variable shapes.

Technically, a kind is a Block of type CELL_TYPE_TUPLE_ITEM. Each item has data (is a Tensor). The way a Kind can include other Kinds is
by merging them together and that increases the ItemHeader.level by one. E.g, a Kind x is made of tensors (a, b) and a Kind y is made of
(c, d, e), we can create a kind (f, x, y) as we merge it together we will just have: (f, x_a, x_b, y_c, y_d, y_e) all of them will have
level 1, except f which will be level 0. The naming convention (mergining with an underscore) is what a Container would do by default when
merging Kinds, but, in manually created Kinds each item can have arbitrary (but different) names. They may have dimensions named length,
width, num_items or whatever and any of them can use these names to define variable dimensions of their tensors anywhere. They do so by
having the names stored as strings and referring to the name (by its index) in the ItemHeader.dim_name[·] where that dimension applies.

Also, kinds always define, at least, these attributes:

- BLOCK_ATTRIB_BLOCKTYPE as the const "kind"
- BLOCK_ATTRIB_TYPE as the const "Kind"

Since kinds keep only metadata, the space is uninterrupted as in a normal block: (header, vector of CELL_TYPE_TUPLE_ITEM, attribute
keys, StringBuffer), which is the only difference between a Kind an a tuple (besides BLOCK_ATTRIB_BLOCKTYPE and BLOCK_ATTRIB_TYPE values).
