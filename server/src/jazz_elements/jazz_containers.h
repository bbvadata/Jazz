/** Root class for all JazzBlock containers, including JazzPersistence containers.

JazzBlocks can be allocated in three ways:

1. One-shot - Created with jazz_containers::new_jazz_block(), destroyed with jazz_containers::new_jazz_block(), owned by the caller.
2. Volatile - Created with jazz_containers::JazzBlockKeepr::new_jazz_block() or (JazzBlockKeepr descendant)::new_jazz_block() and not
required to be removed, but can be removed using (JazzBlockKeepr descendant::)remove_jazz_block(). Some objects (like cache and priority queues)
may remove JazzBlocks from the container to free the space for higher prioritized JazzBlocks. Volatile containers (those not descending from
JazzPersistence) keep the JazzBlockKeeprItem block containers in local RAM, but they may point to blocks physically stored across a cluster.
In volatile containers alloc_keeprs()/realloc_keeprs()/destroy_keeprs() control local allocation of the JazzBlockKeeprItem buffer.
3. Persisted - Created with jazz_persistence::JazzPersistence::new_jazz_block() or (JazzPersistence descendant::)new_jazz_block() and not
required to be removed, but can be removed using (JazzPersistence descendant::)remove_jazz_block(). Unlike volatile JazzBlocks, persisted
JazzBlocks are not controlled by a JazzBlockKeeprItem. Difference between JazzPersistence and JazzSource is the former implements a strict
JazzBlockKeepr interface that can be used from c++ to do things like select information from blocks without assigning or copying them, the
latter has a much simpler interface that is exported to Python and R and provides what a script language programmer would expect at the price
of not always benefitting from the memory-mapped file allocation in lmdb that underlies JazzPersistence.

When an JazzBlockKeepr fills, blocks fail to allocate but never get automatically destroyed.

THREAD SAFETY: All public methods in JazzBlockKeepr descendants must be thread safe. In the core objects, thread-safe failure in public methods
is treated as a top priority bug that is inteded to be spotted in burn-in tests. Private methods can be unsafe, but the public methods calling
them must be aware of their limitations and use thread-locking when necessary. (Copy this message in all descendants.)
