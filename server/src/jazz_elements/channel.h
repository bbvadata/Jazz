/*! \brief A proper type for specifying http status codes

Before libmicrohttpd (somewhere between > 0.9.66-1 and <= 0.9.72-2) changed MHD_Result to an enum, MHD_Result was (improperly) used
to define HTTP responses. That ended-up badly on newer versions, since it was passed to a MHD_queue_response() and stopped working
as it became an enum.

This triggeresd the need, for clarity reasons only, to introduce a new type, MHD_StatusCode to refer to **HTTP responses**.

See: https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml

/** \brief Channels: A Container doing block transactions across media (files, folders, shell, http urls and zeroMQ servers)

NOTES: 1. This is the only container that does not have a native interface. Since urls and file names can be very long the easy interface
is all you need, there is no as_locator() parsing.
2. The container itself does not store (almost) anything. Of course, files and folders are permanent storage and the http call may be
stored by some remote server.
3. Channels support four bases: "0-mq", "bash", "file" and "http". The reference for each base is this docstring.
4. copy() copies across any enabled channels as long as the corresponding get() and put() are correct.

"0-mq" Reference
----------------

The 0-mq implementation in jazz_elements is only a zeroMQ client, not a server. The only operation it supports is a translate() call.
For a translate() call to succeed, you must first have created a pipeline using a put call with a string. E.g,
put("//0-mq/pipeline/speech2text") with a block containing a string like "tcp://localhost:5555" creates a pipeline named speech2text.
Outside Jazz, you set up a zeroMQ server that listens to tcp://localhost:5555 and does speech to text, expecting, say 32-bit int vectors
as input and returning a buffer of char as output. In your translate call you must provide a tuple with two Tensors with item names "input"
and "result". The translate() call will send the raw tensor of the item "input" to the server and write whatever the server answers into
the tensor named "result", just overriding the tensor without any dimension change.
This operation expects the tensor to be binary (i.e., no variable length strings) and their shapes and types known by both parts.
In terms of the Jazz server API, this is a function call: either GET "//0-mq/pipeline/speech2text(//lmdb/stuff/my_tensor)" or
GET "//0-mq/pipeline/speech2text(#[1,2,3];)" the argument can be anything in Persisted, Volatile, even a file or an //http get or
a (%-encoded) constant as in the second example.
When using translate() as the method of Channel, you should omit the "pipeline" part, just translate(p_tuple, "//0-mq/speech2text");

Besides this, get("//0-mq/pipeline/speech2text") will return just a block with "tcp://localhost:5555" and
remove("//0-mq/pipeline/speech2text") will destroy the pipeline. Any other call using "0-mq" returns SERVICE_ERROR_NOT_APPLICABLE.

"0-mq" operation must be enabled via configuration by setting ENABLE_ZEROMQ_CLIENT to something non-zero.

"bash" Reference
----------------

This is also a translate() call, the difference is you don't create the pipline, it always exists and is called "//bash/exec". The Tuple
is an array of byte, both ways "input" and "result". If the size of the "result" buffer is too small for the answer it will be filled up to
the available size and something will be lost. The answer includes whatever a popen("bash script.sh") writes to stdout / stderr (where
script.sh is the content of the "input" tensor).
"bash" operation must be enabled via configuration by setting ENABLE_BASH_EXEC to something non-zero. There is no security check: it can be
used for pushing AI creations to github or kill the server with //bash/exec(# jazz%20stop ;)

"file" Reference
----------------

This read/writes/deletes to the filesystem. Since the API does not use locators, there is no hardcoded name restriction. Via the http
server, just use the URL (#...;). Remember to %-encode whatever http expects to be encoded. E.g., get("//file/#whatever%20you%20want;").
Note that "//file/" is a mandatory prefix, therefore "//file/aa" is "aa" and //file//aa" is "/aa".
get() gets files as arrays of byte and folders as an Index (the keys are file names and the values either "file" or "folder"). put() writes
either Jazz blocks with all the metadata (if mode == WRITE_EVERYTHING) of just the content of the tensor (if mode == WRITE_TENSOR_DATA).
WRITE_ONLY_IF_EXISTS and WRITE_ONLY_IF_NOT_EXISTS work as expected. remove() deletes whatever matches the path either a file or a folder
(with anything inside it).
new_entity() creates a new folder.

"file" operation must be enabled via configuration by setting ENABLE_FILE_LEVEL to 0 (disable everything), 1 (just read), 2 (cannot
override == no remove and WRITE_ONLY_IF_NOT_EXISTS) or 3 (enable everything).

"http" Reference
----------------

Besides being an http server, Jazz is also an http client. The simplest mode of operation is just forwarding get(), put() and delete()
calls that are intended for other nodes in a Jazz cluster. This is done at the top API level by just adding a node name. E.g.,
get("///node_x//lmdb/things/this") will forward the call to the node_x (if anything is well configured see JAZZ_NODE_NAME_.., etc.)
and return the result just as if is was a local call. At the class level, this is done by forward_get(), forward_put() and forward_del().
You can also send simple GET, PUT and DELETE http calls to random urls by either using the get(), put() and remove() or using the Jazz http
server API GET "//http#https://google.com;"

The most advanced way to do it is creating a connection (similar to a "0-mq" pipeline) by put()-ing an Index to: //http/connection/a_name
the index requires the mandatory key URL and the optional keys: CURLOPT_USERNAME, CURLOPT_USERPWD, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE and CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR
(see https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_USERNAME.html and https://everything.curl.dev/libcurl-http/cookies) Once the connection exists, you
can get(), put() and remove() to just its name (without the word connection). I.e, get(txn, "//http/a_name") or
get(txn, "//http/a_name/args") will send the http GET to connection[URL] + "args". Same for put() and remove().

 If you remove("//http/connection/a_name"), you destroy the connection. get("//http/connection/a_name") returns an Index with all the
connection parameters.

"http" operation must be enabled via configuration by setting ENABLE_HTTP_CLIENT to something non-zero.
