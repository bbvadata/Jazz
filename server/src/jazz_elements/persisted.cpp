/** Add the base names for this Container.

	The Persisted object has used-defined databases containing anything, these databases can have any names as long as they do not
interfere with existing base names. The Api object will forward names that do not match any base names to Persisted in case they
are the name of a database (and will fail otherwise).

	Besides these user-defined names, there is a number of reserved databases that keep track of objects. "sys" keeps cluster-level
config, "group" keeps track of all groups (of nodes sharing a sharded resource), "kind" the kinds, "field" the fields, etc.
"static" is a database of objects with attributes BLOCK_ATTRIB_URL and BLOCK_ATTRIB_MIMETYPE exposed via the / API.
