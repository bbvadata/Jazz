	\param result	A Locator to contained the parsed result on success. (Undefined content on error.) It uses the p_extra-> pointer
					in the Locator structure to match an ExtraLocator structure containing the long paths. The structure is owned by
					Channels and has to be released using destroy_extra_locator() which happens automatically when you use the native API.
	\param p_what	Some string to be parsed. (See Syntax below) E.g. //http/http://www.google.com?xy or //http[USERNAME:me]http://ibm.com

	\return	SERVICE_NO_ERROR on success or some negative value (error).

**NOTE**: Because Locators are being replaced by ExtraLocator, all calls to as_locator() **must** be used **just once** by the Native API.
If an ExtraLocator returned by this is not used, you must explicitely call destroy_extra_locator().

Syntax
------

The general syntax is: //{base}/{url} or //{base}[]{url}

The parser will accept anything as the URL or file name, without imposing on character ranges, with the exception of the (optional)
initial []. If the **first** character is a [, a closing ] will be found and anything inside the [] are the **quirks**, the rest is the
URL (or file name).

The quirks have the format [USERNAME:xxx,USERPW:xxx,COOKIEFILE://base/entity/key,COOKIEJAR://base/entity/key] When any of these fields is
given it will populate the corresponding field of the ExtraLocator which will otherwise be NULL.
Both the COOKIEFILE (cookies emitted) and COOKIEJAR (cookies accepted) will be files with short names in a format good for
curl_easy_setopt() https://everything.curl.dev/libcurl-http/cookies The USERNAME is https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_USERNAME.html and
the USERPW https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_USERPWD.html
