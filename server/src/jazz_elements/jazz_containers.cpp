/** Create a new (one_shot) JazzBlock (including a JazzFilter) from scratch

	\param cell_type		The type for the tensor's cell types in [CELL_TYPE_BYTE..CELL_TYPE_DOUBLE]
	\param dim				This defines both the rank and the dimensions of the tensor. Note that, except for the first position a
							dimension of 0 and 1 is the same dim = {3, 1} is a vector of 3 elements with rank 1, exactly like {3, 0}.
							As a matter of convention, dim should always end with a 0 except when it is JAZZ_MAX_TENSOR_RANK long.
							For the first dimension 1 means one element and 0 means no element. Both have rank 1. The latter is the
							typical result of a selection where no row matches the condition. Blocks never have rank == 0 and zero-element
							blocks have the same rank as the block from which they were selected. When 0 rows are selected from a block
							of dim = {r, s, t} the resulting block is {0, s, t} with size == 0 and rank == 3.
							If dim == nullptr and p_text != nullptr, dim will be set automatically to the number of lines (see eoln) in p_text
							when cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING.
	\param att				The attributes to set when creating the block. They are be immutable. To change the attributes of a JazzBlock
							use the version of new_jazz_block() with parameter p_as_block.
	\param fill_tensor		How to fill the tensor. When creating anything that is not a JazzFilter, p_bool_filter is ignored and the options
							are: JAZZ_FILL_NEW_DONT_FILL (don't do anything with the tensor), JAZZ_FILL_NEW_WITH_ZERO (fill with binary zero
							no matter what the cell_type is), JAZZ_FILL_NEW_WITH_NA fill with the appropriate NA for the cell_type)
							When creating a filter, p_bool_filter must be a vector of length == size and the filter will be created as
							boolean (when fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_BOOLEAN_FILTER) or integer (when fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_INTEGER_FILTER)
	\param p_bool_filter	The vector of boolean (each true value means the corresponding row is selected) used when fill_tensor ==
							JAZZ_FILL_BOOLEAN_FILTER and fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_INTEGER_FILTER
	\param stringbuff_size	One of the possible ways to allocate space for strings is declaring this size. When this is non-zero a buffer
							will be allocated with this size plus whatever size is required by the strings in att. new_jazz_block() will
							only allocate the space and do nothing with it. The caller should assign strings to cells with JazzBlock.set_string().
	\param p_text			The other possible way to allocate space for strings is by declaring p_text. Imagine the content of p_text
							as a text file with n = size rows that will be pushed into the tensor and the string buffer. The eoln character
							separates the cells. (cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING & p_text != nullptr) overrides any setting in fill_tensor.
							Also, either dim should be nullptr and set automatically or its resulting size must be the same as the number of
							lines in p_text.
	\param eoln				A single character that separates the cells in p_text and will not be pushed to the string buffer.

	NOTES: String buffer allocation should not be used to dynamically change attribute values. Attributes are immutable and should be changed
	only creating a new block with new = new_jazz_block(p_as_block = old, att = new_att).
	String buffer allocation should only be used for cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING and either with stringbuff_size or with p_text (and eoln).
	If stringbuff_size is used, JazzBlock.set_string() should be used afterwards. If p_text is used, the tensor is already filled and
	JazzBlock.set_string() **should not** be called after that.

	OWNERSHIP: If you create a one shot block using new_jazz_block(), you earn the responsibility to free it with free_jazz_block().
	This is not the normal way to create JazzBlocks, when you use a JazzBlockKeepr descendant, that object will allocate and free
	the JazzBlocks automatically. The same applies to JazzBlocks created in the stack of a bebop program which are also managed
	automatically.

/** Create a new JazzBlock (including a JazzFilter) from scratch owned by a JazzBlockKeeprItem

	\param id64				A binary block ID. When blocks are created by giving a JazzBlockIdentifier, their binary ID is built automatically
							as the hash of their JazzBlockIdentifier (NOT the content of the block). That is the normal way of creating blocks
							and the only way that supports persisted blocks. Volatile blocks may have a "forced" binary id computed as the
							result of the function that creates them and the hashes of its dependencies. To support creating blocks (typically
							cached results of functions) with a give binary id, this form of new_jazz_block() comes in hand. Block items using
							this always have their JazzBlockIdentifier defined as a null string.
	\param cell_type		The type for the tensor's cell types in [CELL_TYPE_BYTE..CELL_TYPE_DOUBLE]
	\param dim				This defines both the rank and the dimensions of the tensor. Note that, except for the first position a
							dimension of 0 and 1 is the same dim = {3, 1} is a vector of 3 elements with rank 1, exactly like {3, 0}.
							As a matter of convention, dim should always end with a 0 except when it is JAZZ_MAX_TENSOR_RANK long.
							For the first dimension 1 means one element and 0 means no element. Both have rank 1. The latter is the
							typical result of a selection where no row matches the condition. Blocks never have rank == 0 and zero-element
							blocks have the same rank as the block from which they were selected. When 0 rows are selected from a block
							of dim = {r, s, t} the resulting block is {0, s, t} with size == 0 and rank == 3.
							If dim == nullptr and p_text != nullptr, dim will be set automatically to the number of lines (see eoln) in p_text
							when cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING.
	\param att				The attributes to set when creating the block. They are be immutable. To change the attributes of a JazzBlock
							use the version of new_jazz_block() with parameter p_as_block.
	\param fill_tensor		How to fill the tensor. When creating anything that is not a JazzFilter, p_bool_filter is ignored and the options
							are: JAZZ_FILL_NEW_DONT_FILL (don't do anything with the tensor), JAZZ_FILL_NEW_WITH_ZERO (fill with binary zero
							no matter what the cell_type is), JAZZ_FILL_NEW_WITH_NA fill with the appropriate NA for the cell_type)
							When creating a filter, p_bool_filter must be a vector of length == size and the filter will be created as
							boolean (when fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_BOOLEAN_FILTER) or integer (when fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_INTEGER_FILTER)
	\param p_bool_filter	The vector of boolean (each true value means the corresponding row is selected) used when fill_tensor ==
							JAZZ_FILL_BOOLEAN_FILTER and fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_INTEGER_FILTER
	\param stringbuff_size	One of the possible ways to allocate space for strings is declaring this size. When this is non-zero a buffer
							will be allocated with this size plus whatever size is required by the strings in att. new_jazz_block() will
							only allocate the space and do nothing with it. The caller should assign strings to cells with JazzBlock.set_string().
	\param p_text			The other possible way to allocate space for strings is by declaring p_text. Imagine the content of p_text
							as a text file with n = size rows that will be pushed into the tensor and the string buffer. The eoln character
							separates the cells. (cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING & p_text != nullptr) overrides any setting in fill_tensor.
							Also, either dim should be nullptr and set automatically or its resulting size must be the same as the number of
							lines in p_text.
	\param eoln				A single character that separates the cells in p_text and will not be pushed to the string buffer.

	NOTES: String buffer allocation should not be used to dynamically change attribute values. Attributes are immutable and should be changed
	only creating a new block with new = new_jazz_block(p_as_block = old, att = new_att).
	String buffer allocation should only be used for cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING and either with stringbuff_size or with p_text (and eoln).
	If stringbuff_size is used, JazzBlock.set_string() should be used afterwards. If p_text is used, the tensor is already filled and
	JazzBlock.set_string() **should not** be called after that.

	OWNERSHIP: If you create a one shot block using new_jazz_block(), you earn the responsibility to free it with free_jazz_block().
	This is not the normal way to create JazzBlocks, when you use a JazzBlockKeepr descendant, that object will allocate and free
	the JazzBlocks automatically. The same applies to JazzBlocks created in the stack of a bebop program which are also managed
	automatically.

	\param p_id				A block ID. A string matching JAZZ_REGEX_VALIDATE_BLOCK_ID to identify the block globally and locally.
	\param cell_type		The type for the tensor's cell types in [CELL_TYPE_BYTE..CELL_TYPE_DOUBLE]
	\param dim				This defines both the rank and the dimensions of the tensor. Note that, except for the first position a
							dimension of 0 and 1 is the same dim = {3, 1} is a vector of 3 elements with rank 1, exactly like {3, 0}.
							As a matter of convention, dim should always end with a 0 except when it is JAZZ_MAX_TENSOR_RANK long.
							For the first dimension 1 means one element and 0 means no element. Both have rank 1. The latter is the
							typical result of a selection where no row matches the condition. Blocks never have rank == 0 and zero-element
							blocks have the same rank as the block from which they were selected. When 0 rows are selected from a block
							of dim = {r, s, t} the resulting block is {0, s, t} with size == 0 and rank == 3.
							If dim == nullptr and p_text != nullptr, dim will be set automatically to the number of lines (see eoln) in p_text
							when cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING.
	\param att				The attributes to set when creating the block. They are be immutable. To change the attributes of a JazzBlock
							use the version of new_jazz_block() with parameter p_as_block.
	\param fill_tensor		How to fill the tensor. When creating anything that is not a JazzFilter, p_bool_filter is ignored and the options
							are: JAZZ_FILL_NEW_DONT_FILL (don't do anything with the tensor), JAZZ_FILL_NEW_WITH_ZERO (fill with binary zero
							no matter what the cell_type is), JAZZ_FILL_NEW_WITH_NA fill with the appropriate NA for the cell_type)
							When creating a filter, p_bool_filter must be a vector of length == size and the filter will be created as
							boolean (when fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_BOOLEAN_FILTER) or integer (when fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_INTEGER_FILTER)
	\param p_bool_filter	The vector of boolean (each true value means the corresponding row is selected) used when fill_tensor ==
							JAZZ_FILL_BOOLEAN_FILTER and fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_INTEGER_FILTER
	\param stringbuff_size	One of the possible ways to allocate space for strings is declaring this size. When this is non-zero a buffer
							will be allocated with this size plus whatever size is required by the strings in att. new_jazz_block() will
							only allocate the space and do nothing with it. The caller should assign strings to cells with JazzBlock.set_string().
	\param p_text			The other possible way to allocate space for strings is by declaring p_text. Imagine the content of p_text
							as a text file with n = size rows that will be pushed into the tensor and the string buffer. The eoln character
							separates the cells. (cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING & p_text != nullptr) overrides any setting in fill_tensor.
							Also, either dim should be nullptr and set automatically or its resulting size must be the same as the number of
							lines in p_text.
	\param eoln				A single character that separates the cells in p_text and will not be pushed to the string buffer.
	\param time_to_build	The time to build the object in microseconds. (this typically includes the evaluation of the function who built it.)
							If that value is known, it may be used to optimize the priority of the block in the queue. In us compatible with
							jazz_utils::elapsed_us().

	NOTES: String buffer allocation should not be used to dynamically change attribute values. Attributes are immutable and should be changed
	only creating a new block with new = new_jazz_block(p_as_block = old, att = new_att).
	String buffer allocation should only be used for cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING and either with stringbuff_size or with p_text (and eoln).

							no matter what the cell_type is), JAZZ_FILL_NEW_WITH_NA fill with the appropriate NA for the cell_type)
							When creating a filter, p_bool_filter must be a vector of length == size and the filter will be created as
							boolean (when fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_BOOLEAN_FILTER) or integer (when fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_INTEGER_FILTER)
	\param p_bool_filter	The vector of boolean (each true value means the corresponding row is selected) used when fill_tensor ==
							JAZZ_FILL_BOOLEAN_FILTER and fill_tensor == JAZZ_FILL_INTEGER_FILTER
	\param stringbuff_size	One of the possible ways to allocate space for strings is declaring this size. When this is non-zero a buffer
							will be allocated with this size plus whatever size is required by the strings in att. new_jazz_block() will
							only allocate the space and do nothing with it. The caller should assign strings to cells with JazzBlock.set_string().
	\param p_text			The other possible way to allocate space for strings is by declaring p_text. Imagine the content of p_text
							as a text file with n = size rows that will be pushed into the tensor and the string buffer. The eoln character
							separates the cells. (cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING & p_text != nullptr) overrides any setting in fill_tensor.
							Also, either dim should be nullptr and set automatically or its resulting size must be the same as the number of
							lines in p_text.
	\param eoln				A single character that separates the cells in p_text and will not be pushed to the string buffer.
	\param time_to_build	The time to build the object in microseconds. (this typically includes the evaluation of the function who built it.)
							If that value is known, it may be used to optimize the priority of the block in the queue. In us compatible with
							jazz_utils::elapsed_us().

	NOTES: String buffer allocation should not be used to dynamically change attribute values. Attributes are immutable and should be changed
	only creating a new block with new = new_jazz_block(p_as_block = old, att = new_att).
	String buffer allocation should only be used for cell_type == CELL_TYPE_JAZZ_STRING and either with stringbuff_size or with p_text (and eoln).
	If stringbuff_size is used, JazzBlock.set_string() should be used afterwards. If p_text is used, the tensor is already filled and
	JazzBlock.set_string() **should not** be called after that.

	OWNERSHIP: If you create a one shot block using new_jazz_block(), you earn the responsibility to free it with free_jazz_block().
	This is not the normal way to create JazzBlocks, when you use a JazzBlockKeepr descendant, that object will allocate and free
	the JazzBlocks automatically. The same applies to JazzBlocks created in the stack of a bebop program which are also managed
	automatically.

	\return	The address of the JazzQueueItem owning the new JazzBlock or nullptr if failed. Will not allocate a JazzQueueItem
	if allocating the JazzBlock fails.
