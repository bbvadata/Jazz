/** \brief Volatile: A Service to manage data objects in RAM.

Node Method Reference
---------------------

Some bases in Volatile, like **deque** which is just a key/value store where each entity is a new keyspace. Keys are keys and values
are blocks of any kind. Other bases have a syntax that allows operating with entities or nodes, like pop()-ing the highest priority
node in a **queue**, accessing to nodes in a tree using the tree pointers or keys to node ids, etc.

The reference for this is this docstring. All entities and keys can be removed with remove(), each time keys are returned, they are
inside a block of just one string, see the methods of each base for more.

Methods in deque
----------------

A deque is a key-value store. It is created empty via new_entity() and you can just get(), header(), put(), remove() or copy(). In order
to  access all the blocks in a deque, the key of the first block will be returned by get()ting //deque/entity/~first. And the keys of
any node can be obtained by //deque/entity/key~next and //deque/entity/key~prev.

Methods in index
----------------

Index both exposes and serializes Index type blocks. An entity inside index is **one single** Index. When get()ting them by key, you get
the value stored in the Index. To create a new one, just new_entity() //index/name/~ss (ii, is, si or ss). To populate one just
put() to //index/name/~load with a Tuple of the appropriate Kind. To save one, just get() //index/name/~save.

Methods in queue
----------------

A priority queue is implemented as self balanced binary trees. Each time you push a block, you must put() to a key with a priority by
putting to //queue/name/key~0.977 (where 0.977 can be serialized to a double). The queue is created by new_entity() //queue/name/~5000
(where 5000 is the mandatory maximum number of nodes). When the queue fills, lower priority nodes are discarded. You can also get()
to //queue/name/~pop_highest, //queue/name/~peek_highest, //queue/name/~pop_lowest, //queue/name/~peek_lowest. And you can get()
nodes by key as in a deque (if they haven't been pop()ed or been discarded).

Methods in tree
---------------

When a tree is created empty, new_entity() //tree/name/, the first node pushed must have key == **root** and is the only node without
a parent. Any node is created by put()ing to //tree/name/key~parentname (where parentname must exist). All nodes support querying keys to
their parent, siblings and first child via: get() //tree/name/key~parent, //tree/name/key~next, //tree/name/key~child.
