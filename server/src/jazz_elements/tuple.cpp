How Tuples and Kinds merge
--------------------------

The way a Kind can include other Kinds is by merging them together in a tree. That increases the ItemHeader.level by one. E.g, a Kind
x is made of tensors (a, b), a Kind y is made of (c, d, e) and f is a tensor. We create a kind (f, x, y). As we merge it together we
will get: (f, x_a, x_b, y_c, y_d, y_e) all of them will have level 1, except f which will be level 0. The naming convention (merging
with an underscore) is what this method does.

Note that: The "level-trick" makes the structure much simpler by just storing the tensors, the tree is encoded in the levels of each tensor
but not necessary to match tuples to kinds. The resulting names must all be different or it will return an error.
