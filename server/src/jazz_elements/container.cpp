/** Create a new Block (1): Create a Block from scratch.

	\param p_keeper			A pointer to a BlockKeeper passed by reference. If successful, the Container will return a pointer to a
							BlockKeeper inside the Container. The caller can only use it read-only and **must** unlock() it when done.
	\param cell_type		The tensor cell type in [CELL_TYPE_BYTE..CELL_TYPE_DOUBLE]
	\param dim				This defines both the rank and the dimensions of the tensor. Note that, except for the first position a
							dimension of 0 and 1 is the same dim = {3, 1} is a vector of 3 elements with rank 1, exactly like {3, 0}.
							As a matter of convention, dim should always end with a 0 except when it is MAX_TENSOR_RANK long.
							For the first dimension 1 means one element and 0 means no element. Both have rank 1. The latter is the
							typical result of a selection where no row matches the condition. Blocks never have rank == 0 and zero-element
							blocks have the same rank as the block from which they were selected. When 0 rows are selected from a block
							of dim = {r, s, t} the resulting block is {0, s, t} with size == 0 and rank == 3.
							If dim == nullptr and p_text != nullptr, dim will be set to the number of lines (see eol) in p_text when
							cell_type == CELL_TYPE_STRING.
	\param att				The attributes to set when creating the block. They are be immutable. To change the attributes of a Block
							use the version of new_jazz_block() with parameter p_as_block.
	\param fill_tensor		How to fill the tensor. When creating anything that is not a filter, p_bool_filter is ignored and the options
							are: FILL_NEW_DONT_FILL (don't do anything with the tensor), FILL_NEW_WITH_ZERO (fill with binary zero
							no matter what the cell_type is), FILL_NEW_WITH_NA fill with the appropriate NA for the cell_type)
							When creating a filter, p_bool_filter must be a vector of length == size and the filter will be created as
							boolean (when fill_tensor == CELL_TYPE_BOOLEAN) or integer (when fill_tensor == CELL_TYPE_INTEGER)
	\param p_bool_filter	The vector of boolean (each true value means the corresponding row is selected) used when fill_tensor ==
							CELL_TYPE_BOOLEAN and fill_tensor == CELL_TYPE_INTEGER
	\param stringbuff_size	One of the possible ways to allocate space for strings is declaring this size. When this is non-zero a buffer
							will be allocated with this size plus whatever size is required by the strings in att. new_jazz_block() will
							only allocate the space and do nothing with it. The caller should assign strings with Block.set_string().
	\param p_text			The other possible way to allocate space for strings is by declaring p_text. Imagine the content of p_text
							as a text file with n = size rows that will be pushed into the tensor and the string buffer. The eol character
							separates the cells. (cell_type == CELL_TYPE_STRING & p_text != nullptr) overrides any setting in fill_tensor.
							Also, either dim should be nullptr and set automatically or its resulting size must be the same as the number
							of lines in p_text.
	\param eol				A single character that separates the cells in p_text and will not be pushed to the string buffer.

	NOTES: String buffer allocation should not be used to dynamically change attribute values. Attributes are immutable and should be
	changed	only creating a new block with new = new_jazz_block(p_as_block = old, att = new_att). String buffer allocation should only be
	used for cell_type == CELL_TYPE_STRING and either with stringbuff_size or with p_text (and eol).
	If stringbuff_size is used, Block.set_string() should be used afterwards. If p_text is used, the tensor is already filled and
	Block.set_string() **should not** be called after that.

	OWNERSHIP: Remember: the p_keeper returned on success points inside the Container. Use it as read-only and don't forget to unlock() it
	when done.

	\return	SERVICE_NO_ERROR on success (and a valid p_keeper), or some negative value (error). There is no async interface in this method.
