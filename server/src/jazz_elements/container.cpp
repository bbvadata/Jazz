/** Create a new Block (1): Create a Block from scratch.

	\param p_keeper			A pointer to a BlockKeeper passed by reference. If successful, the Container will return a pointer to a
							BlockKeeper inside the Container. The caller can only use it read-only and **must** unlock() it when done.
	\param cell_type		The tensor cell type in [CELL_TYPE_BYTE..CELL_TYPE_DOUBLE]
	\param dim				This defines both the rank and the dimensions of the tensor. Note that, except for the first position a
							dimension of 0 and 1 is the same dim = {3, 1} is a vector of 3 elements with rank 1, exactly like {3, 0}.
							As a matter of convention, dim should always end with a 0 except when it is MAX_TENSOR_RANK long.
							For the first dimension 1 means one element and 0 means no element. Both have rank 1. The latter is the
							typical result of a selection where no row matches the condition. Blocks never have rank == 0 and zero-element
							blocks have the same rank as the block from which they were selected. When 0 rows are selected from a block
							of dim = {r, s, t} the resulting block is {0, s, t} with size == 0 and rank == 3.
							If dim == nullptr and p_text != nullptr, dim will be set to the number of lines (see eol) in p_text when
							cell_type == CELL_TYPE_STRING.
	\param att				The attributes to set when creating the block. They are be immutable.
	\param fill_tensor		How to fill the tensor. When creating anything that is not a filter, p_bool_filter is ignored and the options
							are: FILL_NEW_DONT_FILL (don't do anything with the tensor), FILL_NEW_WITH_ZERO (fill with binary zero
							no matter what the cell_type is), FILL_NEW_WITH_NA fill with the appropriate NA for the cell_type)
							When creating a filter, p_bool_filter must be a vector of length == size and the filter will be created as
							boolean (when fill_tensor == CELL_TYPE_BOOLEAN) or integer (when fill_tensor == CELL_TYPE_INTEGER)
	\param p_bool_filter	The vector of boolean (each true value means the corresponding row is selected) used when fill_tensor ==
							CELL_TYPE_BOOLEAN and fill_tensor == CELL_TYPE_INTEGER
	\param stringbuff_size	One of the possible ways to allocate space for strings is declaring this size. When this is non-zero a buffer
							will be allocated with this size plus whatever size is required by the strings in att. new_jazz_block() will
							only allocate the space and do nothing with it. The caller should assign strings with Block.set_string().
	\param p_text			The other possible way to allocate space for strings is by declaring p_text. Imagine the content of p_text
							as a text file with n = size rows that will be pushed into the tensor and the string buffer. The eol character
							separates the cells. (cell_type == CELL_TYPE_STRING & p_text != nullptr) overrides any setting in fill_tensor.
							Also, either dim should be nullptr and set automatically or its resulting size must be the same as the number
							of lines in p_text.
	\param eol				A single character that separates the cells in p_text and will not be pushed to the string buffer.

	NOTES: String buffer allocation should not be used to dynamically change attribute values. Attributes are immutable and should be
	changed	only creating a new block with new = new_jazz_block(p_from = old, att = new_att). String buffer allocation should only be
	used for cell_type == CELL_TYPE_STRING and either with stringbuff_size or with p_text (and eol).
	If stringbuff_size is used, Block.set_string() should be used afterwards. If p_text is used, the tensor is already filled and
	Block.set_string() **should not** be called after that.

	OWNERSHIP: Remember: the p_keeper returned on success points inside the Container. Use it as read-only and don't forget to unlock() it
	when done.

How Tuples and Kinds merge
--------------------------

The way a Kind can include other Kinds is by merging them together in a tree. That increases the ItemHeader.level by one. E.g, a Kind
x is made of tensors (a, b), a Kind y is made of (c, d, e) and f is a tensor. We create a kind (f, x, y). As we merge it together we
will get: (f, x_a, x_b, y_c, y_d, y_e) all of them will have level 1, except f which will be level 0. The naming convention (merging
with an underscore) is what this method does.

Note that: The "level-trick" makes the structure much simpler by just storing the tensors, the tree is encoded in the levels of each tensor
but not necessary to match tuples to kinds. The resulting names must all be different or it will return an error.
