/**< \brief A tuple is a tree of blocks where each edge has a name. A kind is a tuple with indexed dimensions.

A tuple is a tree of blocks where each edge has a name (and no more attributes). The names in the tuple select a specific block
inside the tuple, somehow like the folder names in a directory tree. A kind is an abstract tuple with some dimensions being parameters.
These parameters are indices. This module implements: Tuple, Index and Kind.
