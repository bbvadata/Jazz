/** \brief Tuple: A Jazz data block of a Kind.

An instance of a **Kind**. Physically, like a Kind, it is a single block with some differences:

- It holds data and metadata. (It has a reference to the kind, but that is only interesting in the context of formal fields. Anything
  required to understand the data architecture is in the block itself.)
- It has constant values for the dimensions. E.g., all instances of "image_width" across all items where applicable are, say 640.
- It has different attributes than a Tuple.

Also, tuples always define, if the Container sets them as expected, these attributes:

- BLOCK_ATTRIB_BLOCKTYPE as the const "tuple"
- BLOCK_ATTRIB_TYPE as whatever the inherited class name is ("Tuple" for the main class)
- BLOCK_ATTRIB_KIND as the locator to the definition of the Kind it satisfies. (Can be a tab separated list.)
