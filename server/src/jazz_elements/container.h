L_values do not have contracts. You cannot assign a[4] = "new value".

R_values can have multiple. E.g., you can a = math/average(weather_data/berlin:temp[1,4]).as_json. Note that the parser will first lock
"[1,4]" the constant into a new block. Then, it will lock "weather_data/berlin:temp[..]" which has two contracts: <column> "temp" if berlin
is a table (also possible  <item> "temp" if berlin is a tuple) and <slice> [1,4]. Finally, the call "math/average(..).as_json" on the
locked block has two contracts, a function call and the .as_json(). No step required more than 2. The total number of contracts is not

/** \brief Container: A Service to manage Jazz blocks. All Jazz blocks are managed by this or a descendant of this.

This is the root class for all containers. It has memory alloc for one-shot block allocation and methods for filtering and serialization.
Its descendants are: Volatile, Remote and Persisted, completing all possible block allocations: one-shot, volatile, remote and persisted.

It follows the "rules of the game" using:

- Name, Answer and ContractRequest
- BlockKeeper, Locator
- All the constants, error codes, etc.

It provides a neat API for all descendants, including:

- Transparent thread safety
- An API for async calls (Remote): .sleep() .callback()
- Allocation: .new_block(), .lock(), .unlock()
- Crud: .put(), .remove()
- Support for contracts: .get()
- A configuration style for all descendants

It provides, exposed by the root Container class, but also used internally by descendants;

- A transparent deque of BlockKeeper structures

One-shot Block allocation
-------------------------

This is the only container providing one-shot Block allocation. This does not mean, unlike in previous versions, the caller owns the
pointer. One-shot Block allocation is intended for computing intermediate blocks like: blocks generated from constants, from slicing,
returned by functions, etc. In these blocks, the locator is meaningless, the caller will create it by new_block(), use it and call
unlock() when done.

Instances and inheritance
-------------------------

Note that the descendants don't inherit each other. E.g., Volatile does not have a Remote implementation, but they all have the basic
deque mechanism inherited from Container: i.e., they can all allocate new blocks for their own purposes. Configuration-wise the
allocations set by ONE_SHOT_MAX_KEEPERS, ONE_SHOT_WARN_BLOCK_KBYTES, ... only apply to the instance of the class Container, the
descendants use their own limits in which they include this allocation combined with whatever other allocations they do. The total
allocation of the Jazz node is the sum of all (plus some small amount used by libraries, etc. that is not dependant on data size).
