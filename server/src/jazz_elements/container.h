/** \brief Container: A Service to manage Jazz blocks. All Jazz blocks are managed by this or a descendant of this.

This is the root class for all containers. It has memory alloc for one-shot block allocation and methods for filtering and serialization.
Its descendants are: Volatile, Remote and Persisted, completing all possible block allocations: one-shot, volatile, remote and persisted.

It provides, "rules of the game" for all descendants;

- A Block locator mechanism: Container name, Block name and contracts
- The struc BlockKeeper to store Blocks
- Thread safety (and thread specific storage just for this class)
- An allocation API .new(locked=True), .lock(), .unlock()
- A crud API .get(), .put(only_if=PUT_ALWAYS), .delete()
- Support for Block contracts
- A configuration style that will be honored by all descendants

It provides, specifically for the Container class;

- A deque of BlockKeeper structures: .l_push(), .l_pop(), .l_peek(), .r_push(), .r_pop(), .r_peek()

One-shot Block allocation
-------------------------

This is the only container providing one-shot Block allocation. This does not mean, unlike in previous versions, the caller owns the
pointer. One-shot Block allocation is intended for computing intermediate blocks like: blocks generated from constants, from slicing,
returned by functions, etc. In these blocks, the locator is meaningless, the caller will typically allocate by l_push() and recover
by l_pop(). A Block returned via l_pop() is still owned by the Container and requires explicit .unlock()-ing by the caller.

This also the only container that is thread specific. Anywhere else, blocks are uniquely identified by their locators in a
thread-transparent way for the caller. Since blocks here do not have locators, the whole operation happens in the context of a `thread_idx`.
The `thread_idx` is **not** a thread id as returned by `pthread_self()`, it is an index in the thread pool. Thread-aware services
(normally API and Bebop cores) have a `thread_idx` valid during the lifetime of whatever operations require call to this Container.
