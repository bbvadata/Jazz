/** \brief Container: A Service to manage Jazz blocks. All Jazz blocks are managed by this or a descendant of this.

This is the root class for all containers. It is basically an abstract class with some helpful methods but is not instanced as an object.
Its descendants are: Channels, Volatile and Persisted (in jazz_elements) + anything allocating RAM, E.g., the Api.

There is no class Channel (in singular), copy() is a method that copies blocks across Containers (or different media in Channels).
Channels does all the block transactions across media (files, folders, shell, urls, zeroMQ pipes, Index types, ...).

Container provides a neat API for all descendants, including:

- Transparent thread safety .enter_read() .enter_write() .leave_read() .leave_write() .lock_container() .unlock_container()
- Allocation: .new_block(), .destroy_transaction()
- Crud: .get(), .locate(), .header(), .new_entity(), .put(), .remove(), .copy()
- Code execution: .exec() and .modify()
- Support for container names in the API .base_names()
- A configuration style for all descendants

It provides, exposed by the root Container class, but also used internally by descendants;

- A transparent deque of Transaction structures

One-shot Block allocation
-------------------------

This is the only container providing one-shot Block allocation. This does not mean, unlike in previous versions, the caller owns the
pointer. One-shot Block allocation is intended for computing intermediate blocks like: blocks generated from constants, from slicing,
returned by functions, etc. In these blocks, the locator is meaningless, the caller will create it by new_block(), use it and call
destroy_transaction() when done.

Instances and inheritance
-------------------------

Note that the descendants don't inherit each other, but they all have the basic deque mechanism inherited from Container: i.e., they
can all allocate new blocks for their own purposes. Configuration-wise the allocations set by ONE_SHOT_MAX_TRANSACTIONS,
ONE_SHOT_WARN_BLOCK_KBYTES, ... only apply to the instance of the class Container, the descendants use their own limits in which they
include this allocation combined with whatever other allocations they do. The total allocation of the Jazz node is the sum of all (plus
some small amount used by libraries, etc. that is not dependant on data size).

Container descendants
---------------------

Note that Containers own their Transactions and may allocate p_route blocks including all kinds of things like session cookies or
credentials for libcurl calls. Any container will reroute a destroy_transaction() call to its owner.

Scope of jazz_elements
----------------------

Everything works at binary level, operations on blocks at this level are very simple, just copying, deleting, filtering a Tensor by
(int or bool) indices, filtering a Tuple by item name and support every medium in the more conceivably efficient way.

Code execution
--------------

Code execution covers the methods exec (both for functions and mutators) and modify (a special logic used in channel). Code execution
both runs at "lower level" (opcodes and snippets) or at higher level (concept, semspace, model). Everything goes through exec() both
functions and mutators. See the doc in the namespace jazz_bebop for details.

Calling OpCodes and sippets from a container always wraps around the arguments. This means, even is the opcode is a mutator it does not
modify the original tensor but does a copy-on-write, modifies the copy and returns the copy.

new_block()
-----------

**NOTE** that new_block() has 8 forms. It is always called new_block() to emphasize that what the function does is create a new block (vs.
sharing a pointer to an existing one). Therefore, the container allocates and owns it an requires a destroy_transaction() call when no
longer needed. The forms cover all the supported ways to do basic operations like filtering and serializing.

   -# new_block(): Create a Tensor from raw data specifying everything from scratch.
   -# new_block(): Create a Kind or Tuple from arrays of StaticBlockHeader, names, and, in the case of a tuple, Tensors.
   -# new_block(): Create a Tensor by selecting rows (filtering) from another Tensor.
   -# new_block(): Create a Tensor by selecting an item from a Tuple.
   -# new_block(): Create a Tensor, Kind or Tuple from a Text block kept as a Tensor of CELL_TYPE_BYTE of rank == 1.
   -# new_block(): Create a Tensor of CELL_TYPE_BYTE of rank == 1 with a text serialization of a Tensor, Kind or Tuple.
   -# new_block(): Create an empty Index block. It is dynamically allocated, an std:map, and is destroy_transaction()-ed like the others.
   -# new_block(): Create a Tuple of (key:STRING[length],value:STRING[length]) with the content of an Index.
