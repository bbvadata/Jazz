/** \brief OpCode: stateless functions and mutators. Category theory provides the necessary composition to manage state without
introducing stateless and stateful as separate categories. Only mutators (which introduce addresses) are a separate category.

These functions are known as op-codes and inherit OpCode. They are implemented in C++ in a pack.
