// TODO: From ROADMAP


// Complete anything under jazz_bebop.h which is:

//   * definitions of classes
//   * designing execution mechanism that supports macros (snippets) and objects
//   * collections (field) just one thing, no packs
//   * mechanism to define object (as something that provides an interface to a container)
//   * testing a basic MVP
//   * approving a PR and moving the version towards 0.7.1

// Reaching "wide picture" requirements:

//   1. Build an end-to-end with tests that contains: opcode, field, core. MVP without snippets or mutators.
//   2. Build an end-to-end with tests that adds a mutator.
//   3. Build an end-to-end with tests that adds a snippet.
//   4. Build an end-to-end with tests that adds an uplifted field.
//   5. Remove packs, fields (plural only), cores (plural only).
//   6. Update config (to no packs)
//   7. Update diagrams
//   8. Create a minimal bop with simplest map/reduced arithmetic
//   9. Close PR and push version

// Next step in "big picture": rename jazz_model to jazz_brane and build the bricks for:

//   * concepts
//   * grammar
//   * context
//   * HITS



/** \brief OpCode: stateless functions and mutators. Category theory provides the necessary composition to manage state without
introducing stateless and stateful as separate categories. Only mutators (which introduce addresses) are a separate category.

These functions are known as op-codes and inherit OpCode. They are implemented in C++ in a pack.
