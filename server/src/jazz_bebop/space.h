//TODO: Is row the appropriate abstraction? Is a space somehow always tabular? A row is a key

/** \brief Space: The abstract space.

	This is the abstract parent of DataSpaces, Fields/SemSpaces and Snippet/Concept. A Space is an abstraction over many blocks that
	provides:

	- An abstraction in the form of rows and columns.
	- A mechanism to load and update its own metadata in a persisted way.

	Through inheritance, it provides su things as:

	- Sharding and replication across a cluster.
	- A mechanism to load, update, invalidate blocks. This supports continuous update like in time series.
	- Indexing by time, key, embedding, etc.

	The class Space is mostly empty. It provides the parent virtual interface and the parents of all the auxiliary classes used
	to access data.
