/** \brief Core: The execution unit is now a wrapper around onnx-runtime.

This class:

  * Manages dataspaces.
  * Manages fields.
  * Manages life cycle of Snippets: create from source, from object, update, delete.
  * Compiles or decompiles Snippets.
  * Manages onnx runtime sessions.
  * Runs bop objects.

API Container interface:
------------------------

This is the only interface this class has. Everything, is done using this interface, even when this object is used by a ModelsAPI.

Everything here can be called from the API + destroy_transaction() (You don't override destroy_transaction() since you don't
override new_transaction()). Of course, not everything must be supported, but since it could be called by some possibly nonsensical
API query, it is better to reject whatever is not supported with a proper error code.

The class must support all forms of: `new_entity`, `put`, `remove`, `header`, `get`, `exec`, `modify`.

Unlike in other containers, the override is based on only on types, using the locate() mechanism is optional.
Unlike in other containers, copy() is not called from the API. copy() is just an internal function to copy inside a Container in the
most efficient way.
