/** \brief Snippet: A code snippet and the ancestor of Concept.

A Snippet is a Tuple with items and some attributes. The items are sources and compiled onnx code. The attributes identify it as a Snippet
and manage state ().

Attributes
----------

A snippet always defines two attributes:

BLOCK_ATTRIB_SNIPVERS	: The version of the Snippet '1' reserved for future use or extension in general (Concepts).
BLOCK_ATTRIB_SNIPSTATE	: A four character from SNIPSTATE_EMPTY_SNIPPET to SNIPSTATE_FAILED_RUN_SOURCE

The string is made by binary sorted ASCII characters with 4 fields: general, object, intermediate (body, input, output, reads, writes,
calls) and source. The characters are (lower is problematic: ! (33) is irrecoverable error, 'A'..'Z' (65..90) are
explanations for error states, _ (93) is empty, 'a'..'z' (97..122) are valid states). The order of the fields is general goes in the
top bits when represented as an integer. state() >= SNIPSTATE_CAN_RUN matches any can_run or is_running,
state() < SNIPSTATE_EMPTY_SNIPPET matches any error.

You can also mask using MASK_SNIPSTATE_GENERAL .. MASK_SNIPSTATE_SOURCE to get the state of a specific part of the Snippet. The indices
are defines as SNIP_INDEX_OBJECT .. SNIP_INDEX_WRITES.

Kind
----

A Valid snippet satisfies the Kind defined as KIND_SNIPPET

The items are:

\verbatim
source, input, output, reads, writes, calls, body, object
------  -----------------------------------------  ------
   |                        |                         +--> The Onnx object code
   |                        +----------------------------> The intermediate (preprocessed) source code
   +-----------------------------------------------------> The original source code (If available)
\endverbatim

Item indices: Since the order of the blocks in a tuple are fixed, you can retrieve the items both by name of by index.

Interface
---------

The Snippet object provides an interface to access the text parts as a SnippetText and also returns its state as an
integer and its onnx object as a pointer.

Since Snippets are immutable, the logic of adding blocks to the tuple is managed by the Fields object.
