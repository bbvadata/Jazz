jazz_api.h through a REST API.

//TODO: Write module description for jazz_restapi when implemented.

/** \brief TODO

The REST API supports standard http commands.

GET with a valid rvalue. To read from Jazz.
HEAD with a valid rvalue. Internally the same as GET, but returns the header only.
PUT with a valid lvalue. To write blocks into a Jazz keepr.
DELETE with a valid lvalue. To delete blocks or keeprs (even recursively).
OPTIONS with a string. Parses the string and returns the commands that would accept that string as a URL.
GET with lvalue=rvalue. Assignment in the server. Similar to “PUT(lvalue, GET(rvalue))” without traffic.
There is no support for POST or TRACE, any functions other than those mentioned return an error.

//TODO: Write the JazzHttpServer description
