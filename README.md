## History and Objectives

Jazz started as a research project on fast data processing servers led by Santiago Basaldúa at [BBVA Data & Analytics](https://www.bbvadata.com/) that evolved into an analytical web server. In December 2017 the source code of the server and the R client was released under an Apache 2.0 license.


## Past development

Jazz version 0.1.7 is the project released by BBVA, Jazz 0.2.x was the transition to a new architecture while keeping the server functionally equivalent to
the original.
