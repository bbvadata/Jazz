## Jazz

Jazz a lightweight modular data processing framework, including a web server. It provides data persistence and computation capabilities accessible from R and Python and also through a REST API. 


## History and Objectives

Jazz started as a research project on fast data processing servers led by Santiago Basaldúa at [BBVA Data & Analytics](https://www.bbvadata.com/) that evolved into an analytical web server. In December 2017 the source code of the server and the R client was released under an Apache 2.0 license.

Today, the aim of the project is to pivot the original design into a lightweight server-independent framework.
