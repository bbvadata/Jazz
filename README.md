## Jazz

Jazz is a lightweight modular data processing framework, including a web server. It provides data persistence and computation capabilities accessible from R and Python and also through a REST API.

## History and Objectives

Jazz started as a research project on fast data processing servers led by Santiago Basaldúa at [BBVA Data & Analytics](https://www.bbvadata.com/) that evolved into an analytical web server. In December 2017 the source code of the server and the R client was released under an Apache 2.0 license.


## Current development

Jazz version 0.1.7 is the project released by BBVA, Jazz 0.2.x is the transition to a new architecture while keeping the server functionally equivalent to
the original. The switch to the new architecture comes with Jazz 0.3.1, the first complete product that will be released for evaluation.
